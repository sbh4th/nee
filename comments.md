Thanks for the opportunity to provide some perspective on this new framework for natural experiments. 

[1]
I think it is important to say that there are many things I think are innovative and valuable in the new guidance. 

In particular, I have a lot of respect for the focused and intentional process the authors used to develop the framework with specific input from a wide range of stakeholders. 

The convention of a wide-ranging group of stakeholders ensures that the perspectives of both consumers and producers of natural experiments are considered. 

- Challenges with definitions

- Proof is in the pudding.

As I said, I think one of the clear strengths 

Having said that, let me turn now to what I think is the more challenging and weaker part of the guidance, which in some respects is also the most important, and that is the definition of what constitutes a 'natural experiment'. 

The new framework builds slightly on the old one, but both definitions raise questions about whether one can reliably distinguish between a 'natural experiment' and any other kind of non-randomized etiological study.
